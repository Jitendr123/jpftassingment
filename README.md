# React.js Dashboard Assignment

## Project Overview
This project is a **fully responsive dashboard** built using React.js. The dashboard fetches data from an API and presents it in an **intuitive UI**. Users can switch between **card view** and **analytics mode**, where numerical data is visualized using graphs and pie charts.

## What i use in React.js
Hooks -> useState,useEffect,useContext,useMemo

useContext use for changing the view mode Dark to Light and Light to Dark.

useState -> use for storing data in state.    

useEffect -> use for calling API.
          -> added an event listener and a destroy function so that when component will unmounted even listner will also removed.
           this event listerner use to get size of screen so that i can handle label of chart.
uses Try catch and finally block to handle error and also to free the memory.
i am calling API in Dashboard component and passing data to Card and Analytic component.

Bootstrap -> used Bootstrap loader in it.


##There is Demo data btn in Header component and it will visible only when API is not working.
