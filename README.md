# React.js Dashboard Assignment

## Project Overview
This project is a **fully responsive dashboard** built using React.js. The dashboard fetches data from an API and presents it in an **intuitive UI**. Users can switch between **card view** and **analytics mode**, where numerical data is visualized using graphs and pie charts.

## What i use in React.js
Hooks -> useState,useEffect,useContext,
useContext use for changing the view mode Dark to Light and Light to Dark;
useState -> use for storing data in state.    
useEffect -> use for calling API.
          -> added an event listener and a destroy function so that when component will unmounted even listner will also removed.
           this event listerner use to get size of screen so that i can handle label of chart.
uses Try catch and finally block to handle error and also to free the memory.
## API is not working some times so i set a demo object in data state so that i can work on it properly.
